This is an implementation of an anomaly detector based on
subspace methods.  It looks for changes in sounds detected
by a microphone.

The code uses an ADC-001 A/D cape, which is a 2-channel
A/D board designed for data acquisition in the audio range (50Hz --
15kHz).  The cape takes input from a MIC-001 microphone.
Complete documentation for the ADC-001 cape and MIC-001 
microphone is available under:
